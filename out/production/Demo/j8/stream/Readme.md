Java Stream
A new java.util.stream has been added in Java 8 to perform
filter
map
reduce like operations with the collection.

Stream API will allow sequential as well as parallel execution.

This is one of the best feature for me because
I work a lot with Collections and usually with Big Data,
we need to filter out them based on some conditions.

Stream is abstract datastructure

infinite stream can filter out limit other
